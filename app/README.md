WGU Capstone
Purpose
A native Android application that allows users to plan, organize, and track personal vacations and associated excursions. All data is stored locally on the device using the Room persistence library (SQLite). Users can manage vacation details, attach multiple excursions to each vacation, set date-based alerts, and share vacation information.

How to Operate the Application
PIN Lock
On first launch, the app asks you to create a PIN (at least 4 digits) to protect your data. Only a salted SHA-256 hash of the PIN is stored — never the PIN itself.
On every launch after that, you must enter the correct PIN before the Home Screen is reachable.
---
Home Screen
After unlocking, you land on the Home Screen.
Tap "View My Vacations" to navigate to the vacation list.
Tap "Trip Report" to open the combined search/report screen.
---
Vacation List (B1a, B2, C)
Displays all saved vacations as cards showing the title and date range.
Search box at the top filters vacations live by title or hotel.
If no vacations exist (or none match the search), an empty-state message is shown.
Tap the floating action button (FAB / +) in the bottom-right corner to create a new vacation.
Tap any vacation card to open its detail view.

---
Alerts and Notifications (B3e, B5d)
Alerts are set per-vacation (start or end) and per-excursion.
On the scheduled date, the device fires a system notification:
Vacation start: `"\[Vacation Title] is starting today!"`
Vacation end: `"\[Vacation Title] is ending today!"`
Excursion: `"\[Excursion Title] excursion is today!"`
Notifications require the app to have notification permissions granted (prompted on first launch on Android 13+).
---
Sharing a Vacation (B3f)
From the Vacation Detail menu, select Share.
The Android share sheet opens pre-populated with all vacation details including any linked excursions.
You can share via SMS, email, clipboard, or any installed share target.
---
Trip Report
Accessed from the Home Screen ("Trip Report" button).
Combines every vacation and excursion into one report, each row showing Type, Title, Date, and a Detail column (hotel for vacations, category + parent vacation for excursions).
A search box filters the report by keyword across both types.
The report header shows the report title and a "Generated: <date-time>" timestamp that refreshes every time the results change.
---
